                <p>Hi there! I'm an iOS Developer working at <a href="https://www.futureworkshops.com">Future Workshops</a>. I was born and raised in Menorca, but I decided to move to Barcelona in 2015. That same year I started writing apps for the iPhone and the iPad, and I've been building iOS apps full-time since then. Still loving it.</p>

                <h2>How do I work</h2>
                <p>My bread & butter is Swift, even though I've been writing Objective-C &#129429; on frameworks due to the lack of ABI stability for the time being.</p>

                <p>I try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep the code as simple as possible</a>, and I try to keep the usage of third party dependencies to a minimum. I don't agree on using VIPER, MVVM, MVP or the <a href="https://iosarchitecture.top">new hot architectural pattern</a> that's trendy this week without a compelling reason.</p>

                <p>At the time of this writing, I tend to work using <a href="http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/">MVC + Coordinators</a> as my architectural pattern. Most of the time my UI is built on Interface Builder using XIBs. Not having dependency injection on Storyboards is a complete deal breaker. My model layer is always CoreData because I'm a huge fan of NSFetchedResultsController.</p>

                <p>I'm also a firm believer in following the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/">Human Interface Guidelines</a> in order to produce beautiful and usable apps. They're there for a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">reason</a>.</p>
