    				<p>
    					Hello! I'm an iOS Developer working at <a class="link link-red" href="https://www.futureworkshops.com">Future Workshops</a> in Barcelona.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					I started my journey on the Apple ecosystem back in 2015 (iOS 8), and I've been building iOS apps full time since then. I've worked either as the one and only iOS Developer for an app and also in small teams.
    				</p>
                    <p>
                        My bread & butter is Swift, even though I've been writing Objective-C on frameworks due to the lack of <a class="link link-orange" href="https://swift.org/abi-stability">ABI stability</a> in Swift (I want to be able to delete this observation so bad... #swift5)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tend to work using <a class="link link-grey" href="http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/">MVC+Coordinators</a> as my architectural pattern. 99% of the time my UI is built on Interface Builder using .xib files (.storyboard prevents you from having Dependency Injection, which is a no-go for me). My persistance is always Core Data, hidden away by the usage of Protocols to maskerade the NSManagedObjects (I'm very fond of NSFetchedResultsControllers).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I've also worked with Vision & CoreImage to extract data from images, MapKit to plot routes on maps, CoreLocation + ARKit to pin real places in an AR world, etc. I'm a firm believer on following the <a class="link link-tealblue" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/">Human Interface Guidelines</a> written by Apple, and I always strive for a good balance between UI and UX.
                    </p>
