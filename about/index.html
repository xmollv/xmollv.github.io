            <h1>hey there!</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Xavi Moll, a Senior iOS developer who has been building apps for Apple platforms (mainly iOS!) for the past 10 years. I've worked in a wide variety of companies, from very small teams â€” even shipping apps completely by myself â€” to large teams with massive codebases. I've worked on consumer social media apps, enterprise apps, photo/video capture apps, public SDKs, and more. I'm an expert in Swift, UIKit, Core Data, SwiftUI, and Swift Concurrency. I dabble in Objective-C when there's a need for it.
            </p>

            <p>
                I thrive in startups since I'm a 'get things done' kind of developer. I love no-BS startup environments where everyone is encouraged to know everything and where everyone's happy to lend a helping hand. I like to take full ownership of the iOS codebase to make it better on a daily basis, always exploring how to take it to the next level. I believe asynchronous communication (write things down!) is key in remote environments.

                I'm also an independent app developer with apps published on the App Store since 2018. Make sure to check them out <a href="../apps/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>!
