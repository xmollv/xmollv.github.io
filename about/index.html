                I'm Xavi Moll, an iOS developer who has been building app for Apple platforms for the past 10 years. I've worked in a wide variety of companies and apps, from very small teams â€”even shipping apps completely by myselfâ€” to large teams with massive codebases. I've worked in consumer social media apps, enterprise apps, photo/video capture apps, public SDKs, etc. I'm an expert in Swift, UIKit and Core Data, SwiftUI and Swift Concurrency. I dabble in Objective-C when there's the need for it.

                I thrive in startups since I'm a 'get things done' kind of developer. I love the no BS startup environments where everybody is encouraged to know everything and where everybody's happy to hand a helping hand. I like to take full ownership of the iOS codebase to make it better on a daily basis, always exploring how to take it to the next level. I believe asynchronous communication (write things down!) is key on remote environments.
