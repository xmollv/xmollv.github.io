# About Me
Hi there! I'm Xavi Moll and I'm an iOS Developer working at [Future Workshops](https://www.futureworkshops.com) in Barcelona, Spain. I started my journey on the Apple ecosystem back in 2015, and I've been building iOS apps full-time since then.

## How do I work
My bread & butter is Swift, even though I've been writing Objective-C ðŸ¦• on frameworks.

I try to [keep the code as simple as possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), and I have strong feelings against using dependencies for code that you can write yourself. The same applies to using VIPER, MVVM, MVP or the [new hot architectural pattern](https://iosarchitecture.top) that's trendy this week.

I tend to work using [MVC+Coordinators](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/) as my architectural pattern because it's been proven successful in every way. Most of the time my UI is built on Interface Builder using `.xib` files due to the lack of dependency injection on `.storyboards`. My model layer is `CoreData` if persistence is a requirement.

I'm a firm believer in following the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/) in order to make the app feel like a 1st party app and I always strive for a good balance between UI and UX.

## Projects

### Llitgi
Llitgi is an iOS client for [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) available for iPhone and iPad. It has the same features of the 1st party app (the ones made available to the 3rd party developers), but it's much faster because everything is stored on device. You can view it on [GitHub](https://github.com/xmollv/Llitgi) or on the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1355340767).
