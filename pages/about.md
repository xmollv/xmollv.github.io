# About Me
Hi there! I'm Xavi Moll and I'm an iOS Developer working at [Future Workshops](https://www.futureworkshops.com) in Barcelona, Spain.

## How do I work
I started my journey on the Apple ecosystem back in 2015, and I've been building iOS apps full-time since then. My bread & butter is Swift, even though I've been writing Objective-C ðŸ¦• on frameworks.

I try to [keep the code as simple as possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), and I have strong feelings against using dependencies for code that you can write yourself. The same applies to using VIPER, MVVM, MVP or the [new hot architectural pattern](https://iosarchitecture.top) that's trendy this week.

I tend to work using [MVC+Coordinators](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/) as my architectural pattern because it's been proven successful in every way. Most of the time my UI is built on Interface Builder using `.xib` files due to the lack of dependency injection on `.storyboards`. My model layer is `CoreData` if persistence is a requirement.

I've also worked with `Vision` & `CoreImage` to extract data from images, `MapKit` to plot routes on maps, `CoreLocation` + `ARKit` to pin real places in an AR world, etc. I'm a firm believer in following the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/), and I always strive for a good balance between UI and UX.
