Hi there! I'm an iOS Developer working at [Future Workshops](https://www.futureworkshops.com) in Barcelona.

I started my journey on the Apple ecosystem back in 2015, and I've been building iOS apps full-time since then. My bread & butter is `Swift`, even though I've been writing `Objective-C` on frameworks due to the lack of [ABI stability](https://swift.org/abi-stability) in Swift for the time being.

I tend to work using [MVC+Coordinators](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/) as my architectural pattern. Most of the time my UI is built on `Interface Builder` using `.xib` files due to the lack of dependency injection on `.storyboards`. And of course, my model layer is always `CoreData`.

I've also worked with `Vision` & `CoreImage` to extract data from images, `MapKit` to plot routes on maps, `CoreLocation` + `ARKit` to pin real places in an AR world, etc. I'm a firm believer in following the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/), and I always strive for a good balance between UI and UX.
